Using this Site
---------------

Using this website is pretty easy, if you know how to create folders and drop images in them you're in great shape! All you have to do is:

  - Host the files via FTP
  - Create folders that will appear on the navigation menu on the left
  - Add images to those folders
  - If you want to add text like this section here, drop a .txt file into the folder

Some other things you might need to know, if you want to add a folder with a space in the name use a dash instead of a space. e.g. "fathers-day".

Also if you want to add a text area like this then add a ".txt" file in the folder you want, and the formatting is all in Markdown. 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:
